Project Title:
Purrfectly Stylish Cats: A Cat Fashion Trend Tracker 

Project Overview:
This project is an interactive platform where users can contribute and explore the latest in over-the-top cat fashion trends. Users can log in, add new trends, update existing trends, and vote on the "silliness" of various cat fashion styles. Whether it’s cats in tuxedos or in LED light-up collars, this list will showcase the quirkiest and funniest feline fashion moments.

The project will allow for personalized lists per user, with the ability to rate trends and comment on them. As a user interacts with the platform, their experience will be unique based on their own submitted trends, ratings, and engagement with others’ entries.

Key Features:

User Login & Authentication: Each user can log in and view their personalized list of cat fashion trends.
CRUD Operations for Trends: Users can add, update, or delete their own cat fashion trends, as well as rate existing trends based on "silliness."
Trend Rating: Every trend has a silliness rating, and users can vote on how ridiculous they think the outfit is.
User Comments & Interaction: Users can comment on trends to discuss and share their opinions.
Authentication & Session Management: Use session storage for secure user login and password management.
Personalized Lists: Users see different lists based on what they have contributed and rated.
Dynamic Content Updates: The list updates dynamically based on user interaction, showing the most popular or recently added trends.
Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose (for database and user data management)
Frontend: React, Vite (for the development environment and component setup)
Authentication: Session management for user login (with optional Firebase auth if time allows)
Deployment: Backend on Heroku (or any similar service), frontend on Vercel or Netlify
Additional Tools: Postman for API testing, Bruno for user management (if applicable)
Why This Project:
I chose this project because it’s a fun and lighthearted way to showcase the technical skills I’ll be developing in this course. Not only will it allow me to work through all of the concepts listed (such as setting up the API, user authentication, CRUD operations, and deploying both the frontend and backend), but it also lets me build something creative and unique. The ridiculousness of the concept will keep the project fun while I dive into learning about things like database management, React components, and API development. It also gives me an opportunity to build a fully interactive user experience and focus on both backend and frontend technologies.
